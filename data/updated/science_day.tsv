‘Mini-lungs’ reveal early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection: virus reaches full cellular infection 6 hours after infection. 60 hours after infection, alveolar cells disintegrate, leading to damage to lung tissue. But clinical symptoms can take more than 10 days after exposure to appear.	37856	745	2020-10-25 14:19:56	None	None
