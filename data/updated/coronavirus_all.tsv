Hi, I am Ekrem Imamoglu, Mayor of Istanbul, the largest city in Europe. AMA about our fight back against COVID-19.	15364	244	2020-05-18 16:51:47	"Proof it's me: [https://i.imgur.com/dhZfG7s.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/dhZfG7s.jpg)

The pandemic has disrupted our lives throughout the globe, and Istanbul has been no exception.

We as the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality are responsible for providing and maintaining services in transportation, infrastructure, environment, utilities, arts, culture, social aid, sports, and a lot more to a city of 16 million people.

My team and I are now dealing with unprecedented challenges in each of our areas of operation, along with a few rare opportunities.

We have been working round the clock for the past few months to help limit the contagion of the disease and provide relief for those bearing the brunt of the pandemic. Simultaneously, we are taking advantage of the lockdown as an opportunity to cleanse and disinfect public spaces, repave major roads and squares, upgrade our drainage systems, continue the construction of our new metro lines, and enhance cooperation with our international partners and counterparts.

Just like everywhere, the pandemic has brought out the best of our people. In less than a week, our fellow citizens have raised over $2 million in solidarity via our bill-on-the-hook campaign to pay the water and gas bills of those Istanbulites financially struggling during the lockdown.

I will be here for the next hour to share our experience and answer your questions.

**UPDATE:** It is now 17:08 in Istanbul and I have to sign off. Thank you everyone for your questions, and special thanks to r/Coronavirus moderators for inviting me to do this AMA. As a concluding note, I would like to remind everyone that the struggle against COVID-19 is a global one. As I keep saying in Turkish: Birlikte başaracağız - we will get through this together!

If you want to stay up to date with what's going on in Istanbul, follow my English account on Twitter: [http://twitter.com/imamoglu\_int](http://twitter.com/imamoglu_int)"	['https://i.imgur.com/dhZfG7s.jpg', 'http://twitter.com/imamoglu_int']

I'm a critical care doctor working in a UK high consequence infectious diseases centre. Many units are totally full, and we are scrambling to create more capacity. The initial UK government approach has been a total failure. Ask me anything.	11311	776	2020-03-23 18:39:28	"Hey r/Coronavirus. After two very long weeks, I'm back for another AMA. If you didn't see my last, I look after critically ill COVID patients in a UK centre. The last time we talked, there were around 20 patients admitted to critical care for COVID nationally. A week after that post, that number was over 200 confirmed (with at least as many suspected cases) across the country. In London, the number has been doubling every few days.

I have a couple of days off, and I'm here to take questions on the current situation, the UK government response, or anything else you might want to talk about.

Like before, I'm remaining anonymous as this allows me to answer questions freely and without association to my employer (and I'm also not keen on publicity or extra attention or getting in trouble with my hospital's media department).

Thanks, I look forwards to your questions.

EDIT: GMT 1700. Thanks for the discussion. Sorry about the controversy - I realise my statement was provocative and slightly emotional - I've removed some provocative but irrelevant parts. I hasten to stress that I am apolitical. I'll be back to answer a few more later. For those of you who haven't read the paper under discussion where Italian data was finally taken into account, this article might be interesting:  [https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/03/17/1584439125000/That-Imperial-coronavirus-report--in-detail-/](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/03/17/1584439125000/That-Imperial-coronavirus-report--in-detail-/)

EDIT: Thanks for all the questions. I really hope that we will not get to where Italy are, now that quarantine measures are being put into place, and now that hospitals are adding hundreds of critical care extra beds. Stay safe!"
