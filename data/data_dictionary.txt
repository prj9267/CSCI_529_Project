			Post Content: Over the years I’ve had a chance to study diseases like influenza, Ebola, and now COVID-19—including how epidemics start, how to prevent them, and how to respond to them. The Gates Foundation has committed up to $100 million to help with the COVID-19 response around the world, as well as $5 million to support our home state of Washington.

I’m joined remotely today by [Dr. Trevor Mundel](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Who-We-Are/General-Information/Leadership/Executive-Leadership-Team/Trevor-Mundel), who leads the Gates Foundation’s global health work, and [Dr. Niranjan Bose](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niranjan-bose-014b00/), my chief scientific adviser.

Ask us anything about COVID-19 specifically or epidemics and pandemics more generally.

The pandemic has disrupted our lives throughout the globe, and Istanbul has been no exception.

We as the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality are responsible for providing and maintaining services in transportation, infrastructure, environment, utilities, arts, culture, social aid, sports, and a lot more to a city of 16 million people.

My team and I are now dealing with unprecedented challenges in each of our areas of operation, along with a few rare opportunities.

We have been working round the clock for the past few months to help limit the contagion of the disease and provide relief for those bearing the brunt of the pandemic. Simultaneously, we are taking advantage of the lockdown as an opportunity to cleanse and disinfect public spaces, repave major roads and squares, upgrade our drainage systems, continue the construction of our new metro lines, and enhance cooperation with our international partners and counterparts.

Just like everywhere, the pandemic has brought out the best of our people. In less than a week, our fellow citizens have raised over $2 million in solidarity via our bill-on-the-hook campaign to pay the water and gas bills of those Istanbulites financially struggling during the lockdown.

I will be here for the next hour to share our experience and answer your questions.

**UPDATE:** It is now 17:08 in Istanbul and I have to sign off. Thank you everyone for your questions, and special thanks to r/Coronavirus moderators for inviting me to do this AMA. As a concluding note, I would like to remind everyone that the struggle against COVID-19 is a global one. As I keep saying in Turkish: Birlikte başaracağız - we will get through this together!

			Post Content: Hey r/Coronavirus. After two very long weeks, I'm back for another AMA. If you didn't see my last, I look after critically ill COVID patients in a UK centre. The last time we talked, there were around 20 patients admitted to critical care for COVID nationally. A week after that post, that number was over 200 confirmed (with at least as many suspected cases) across the country. In London, the number has been doubling every few days.

I have a couple of days off, and I'm here to take questions on the current situation, the UK government response, or anything else you might want to talk about.

Like before, I'm remaining anonymous as this allows me to answer questions freely and without association to my employer (and I'm also not keen on publicity or extra attention or getting in trouble with my hospital's media department).

Thanks, I look forwards to your questions.

EDIT: GMT 1700. Thanks for the discussion. Sorry about the controversy - I realise my statement was provocative and slightly emotional - I've removed some provocative but irrelevant parts. I hasten to stress that I am apolitical. I'll be back to answer a few more later. For those of you who haven't read the paper under discussion where Italian data was finally taken into account, this article might be interesting:  [https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/03/17/1584439125000/That-Imperial-coronavirus-report--in-detail-/](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/03/17/1584439125000/That-Imperial-coronavirus-report--in-detail-/)

EDIT: Thanks for all the questions. I really hope that we will not get to where Italy are, now that quarantine measures are being put into place, and now that hospitals are adding hundreds of critical care extra beds. Stay safe!

Therefore, we are calling on YOU, our users, to help scientists progress research!

**What does this mean?**

This post will host all of the studies/surveys for users to participate in. **Participation is strictly voluntary, and you may withdraw from any of the below studies at any time.** This post will be stickied to the r/Coronavirus subreddit whenever possible in order to give these projects ample exposure.

**For Researchers:** If you would like to have your study/survey posted, please [send us modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FCoronavirus) and we will give you instructions on how to verify your study.

In addition, there is a useful resource available for researchers from SafeGraph. They are sharing their data and that of their partners free for non-commercial and academic research use. To access this database, please [click here](https://www.safegraph.com/covid-19-data-consortium?utm_source=consortium_outreach&utm_campaign=consortium_rd)

**For Users:** Feel free to click on the links to any of the studies posted here that interest you and for which you qualify. Again, you are under no obligation to participate in any of the studies listed.


**Disclaimer:** All of the studies posted here have been verified to be authentic studies, either from a recognized research facility, government organization, or academic institution, and are conducted with all the necessary ethical and legal considerations. Individual studies may outline their specific disclaimers in the comments.

**NOTE: This post will remain active at all times. Please check back intermittently as we will be adding new studies on a regular basis. We may unpin the post from our front page to promote featured projects or AMAs, but we will re-pin it after the special events have ended. Individual comments with study details will be removed when the study has ended.**

I'm here to answer your questions about medical misinformation, how you can spot the signs and stop the spread. Ask me anything!

On this day, the United Nations initiative [Verified](https://shareverified.com/en) is asking everyone to [#PledgetoPause](http://pledgetopause.org/) before sharing information online. This campaign aims to stop the spread of harmful misinformation by interrupting the emotional rush it activates and triggering critical thinking, which helps to spot the signs.

			Post Content: Science and technology development has been the story of the past 100 years.  The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate, much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA.  At these universities, a substantial amount of the work is done by graduate students, who work long hours (80 hours weeks aren't unusual) for little pay.  These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs, where their innovations make more jobs for others.  


Start-ups develop to bring new innovations based on the skills graduate students learn (Google was the project of a couple of Stanford grad students, even Reddit benefited from the skills of a physics grad student/PhD, /u/keysersosa, the current CTO.)  Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for  those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices, a system that has greatly benefited all of us.


This is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students [going up by as much as 300%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/graduate-students-say-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-their-taxes-by-nearly-300/), which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%. As a former grad student myself, I can tell you that I would not have been able to continue if my pay had be reduced by $7,000, and many students would make the same conclusion.  Instead, some will not go into science or they will leave the USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia, most of these students will never return to the USA. 


This is why every major science organization has [voiced opposition to the current tax plan](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS%20Multisociety%20Letter%20on%20Tax%20Reform.pdf?D1fnCM0H.C.qegz_Yo2wJwPV7IWBzuGy), make no mistake, this plan will [undermine research and eventually the economy of the USA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-05925-6).

In comic form from [PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1985).


What can we do to stop it?  Call your representatives in congress and let them know.  It hasn't passed yet, but it's about to.  If we don't raise voices now, we will all regret it.

			Post Content: I signed an open letter earlier this year imploring researchers to balance the benefits of AI with the risks. The letter acknowledges that AI might one day help eradicate disease and poverty, but it also puts the onus on scientists at the forefront of this technology to keep the human factor front and center of their innovations. I'm part of a campaign enabled by Nokia and hope you will join the conversation on http://www.wired.com/maketechhuman. Learn more about my foundation here: http://stephenhawkingfoundation.org/ 
 

Due to the fact that I will be answering questions at my own pace, working with the moderators of /r/Science we are opening this thread up in advance to gather your questions. 
 

My goal will be to answer as many of the questions you submit as possible over the coming weeks. I appreciate all of your understanding, and taking the time to ask me your questions.


**Moderator Note**

This AMA will be run differently due to the constraints of Professor Hawking.  The AMA will be in two parts, today we with gather questions.  Please post your questions and vote on your favorite questions, from these questions Professor Hawking will select which ones he feels he can give answers to.  

Once the answers have been written, we, the mods, will cut and paste the answers into this AMA and post a link to the AMA in /r/science so that people can re-visit the AMA and read his answers in the proper context.  The date for this is undecided, as it depends on several factors.  

Professor Hawking is a guest of /r/science and has volunteered to answer questions; please treat him with due respect. **Comment rules will be strictly enforced, and uncivil or rude behavior will result in a loss of privileges in /r/science.**

			Post Content: Hello everyone,

Earlier today [President Trump announced his intention to exit the Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-to-announce-us-will-exit-paris-climate-deal/2017/06/01/fbcb0196-46da-11e7-bcde-624ad94170ab_story.html?). While r/science ~~does not take a stance on political issues~~ *generally strives not to take a political stance, this issue is so exceptional and is heavily science-related that we made an exception*. We feel the need to reaffirm our commitment to solid science, and in that regard we strongly disagree with these actions. [Climate change is real](https://climate.nasa.gov/) and it's happening right now. [There is still time left to do something about it](https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/urgentissues/global-warming-climate-change/index.htm), but this requires the actions of all people of the world. 

We decided to create this thread to welcome discussion and questions from the users about climate change and the Paris Agreement. We will be moderating this thread [less heavily than we normally do](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules), but we still ask that you be civil and respectful in the comments.  Comments that go against established science must include **peer-reviewed** citations, and egregious dismissals may result in bans.

EDIT: Please note the edits above in italics. 

r/askscience is [also holding a megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6ertms/askscience_megathread_climate_change/) on this issue. Feel free to ask questions there as well.

Over that time we've brought some big names in, including [Stephen Hawking](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3nyn5i/science_ama_series_stephen_hawking_ama_answers/), [Michael Mann](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1yj3o7/science_ama_series_im_michael_e_mann/), [Francis Collins](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/4gcwwy/science_ama_series_i_am_francis_collins_current/), and even [Monsanto!](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3b6mr4/science_ama_series_im_fred_perlak_a_long_time/).  All told we've hosted more than 1200 AMAs in this time.


We've proudly given a voice to the scientists working on the science, and given the community here a chance to ask them directly about it.  We're grateful to our many guests who offered their time for free, and took their time to answer questions from random strangers on the internet.


However, due to changes in how posts are ranked [AMA visibility dropped off a cliff.](https://imgur.com/a/Xf3F1m0) without warning or recourse.


We aren't able to highlight this unique content, and readers have been largely unaware of our AMAs.  We have attempted to utilize every route we could think of to promote them, but sadly nothing has worked.  


Rather than march on giving false hopes of visibility to our many AMA guests, we've decided to call an end to the program.

>Three Laureates share this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics for their discoveries about one of the most exotic phenomena in the universe, the black hole. Roger Penrose showed that the general theory of relativity leads to the formation of black holes. Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez discovered that an invisible and extremely heavy object governs the orbits of stars at the centre of our galaxy. A supermassive black hole is the only currently known explanation.

>This year's Nobel Prize is awarded to three scientists who have made a decisive contribution to the fight against blood-borne hepatitis, a major global health problem that causes cirrhosis and liver cancer in people around the world.  
>  
>Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice made seminal discoveries that led to the identification of a novel virus, Hepatitis C virus. Prior to their work, the discovery of the Hepatitis A and B viruses had been critical steps forward, but the majority of blood-borne hepatitis cases remained unexplained. The discovery of Hepatitis C virus revealed the cause of the remaining cases of chronic hepatitis and made possible blood tests and new medicines that have saved millions of lives.
